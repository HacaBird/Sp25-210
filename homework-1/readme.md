## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are used to show off static text and information. Web applications are more so made to be interactive and let people do certain tasks for that intended program. Websites are more often better to infrom people and get information across. Web applications are there to help get people participating and interacting.

### VS Code & Extensions

- VS code is the program we will be working with for this class
- VS code is an open-source code editor
- The extensions we use are prettier, live server, and auto rename
- The extensions help to change the program and make things faster
- There are also extensions use for fun like the desk pets

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Github allows people to share code as well as work together and collabarate. You can make repositories on github that allow you to keep your codes and files organized. Git essentially takes a screenshot of your files. Version control keeps your files well organzied.

### Markdown & Documentation

- Code that can help create readmes
- Read me's can later be used as personal "cheat sheets"
- Markdown makes it easier to create organzied documents without the html tags getting too complex
