### Blog Topic

I chose to make a blog about poetry becasue it's something I love to do in my freetime and I thought it would be fun. I also like the vibes of poetry and writing so it just made making the actual website more engaging for me. It could be used to inspire people to write, share resources for others, or just used as an influencer page of sorts.

### Key Takeaways

For this I assignment I created a navigation system, properly styled it, and created basic pages. I then used div classes to styalize my content boxes more thoroughly. I used anchor tags for the navigation system to link to my other html pages. I used a lot of our past learned techniques like using headings, paragraph tags, and images. I think overall I had fun with it and probably spent more time than I should havemaking it look pretty, but it was worth it.
